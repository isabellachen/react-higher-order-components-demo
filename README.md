# Higher Order Components with React

A project that demos how to utilise Higher Order Components to connect stateless components to dispatch and to reuse props among these components.
Of course now, HOC's have gone out of fashion, replaced by the [render props pattern](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html)

To see changes, you'll need to have [redux devtools for Chrome](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) installed.
